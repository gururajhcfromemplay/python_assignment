# python_assignment


Completed the following tasks :

1. Intro to Version Control
Write a brief description (about 100 words) explaining the importance of version control and how it benefits developers.

2. Setting up GitHub
Create a new GitHub account (if you havenâ€™t already).
Set up an SSH key for secure communication with your repositories.

3. Repo Management
Create a new public repository named "python_assignment".
Add a detailed README file explaining the purpose of the repository.
Create a .gitignore file that excludes Python specific unwanted files (e.g., .pyc files, pycache directories, etc.)

4. Git Basics
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Add a sample Python script named "sample.py".
Commit the changes with an appropriate commit message.
Push the changes back to the remote repository on GitHub.

5. Branching and Merging
Create a new branch named "feature".
Modify the "sample.py" script in some way within this branch.
Commit the changes.
Switch back to the main branch and make a different change to "sample.py" (this is to simulate and then resolve a merge conflict).
Merge the "feature" branch into the main branch. Resolve any conflicts manually if they arise.

6. Pull Requests
Create a new branch named "new_feature".
Make changes to "sample.py" or add a new script.
Push the branch to the remote repository.
Create a pull request from "new_feature" to the main branch.
Review the pull request, leave a comment, and then merge it. Ensure the merged code has no issues.

7. Issue Tracking
Open a new issue in your repository, labeling it as a "bug" and give it a description of a fictional problem in "sample.py".
Link this issue in a commit message where you "fix" this fictional problem.
Close the issue after the commit is pushed to the main branch.
Add a milestone for a future "version 2.0" of your repository and associate it with a new issue.
